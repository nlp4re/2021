NLP4RE welcomes four types of papers:

## Technical Design Papers

**Maximum length 8 pages (plus 1 page for references)**, describing novel technical solutions for the application of NLP technologies to RE-relevant artifacts. The papers in this category include preliminary solutions to RE problems, with an early validation.

## Experience Papers

**Maximum length 8 pages (plus 1 page for references), **describing practical experiences in the application of NLP technologies to RE-relevant artifacts. The papers in this category include experience reports, industrial case studies, controlled experiments, and other types of empirical studies conducted to practically assess existing technical solutions.

## Report Papers

**4 pages (plus 1 page for references)**, in which the authors provide an overview on the current and past research of their team, describing what they have been doing on the workshop's topics, and/or what they are doing, and/or what they plan to do. These contributions do not require novelty with respect to previous work, and are oriented to foster discussion and networking. A non-mandatory **template** for Report Papers can be dowloaded [here](http://fmt.isti.cnr.it/nlp4re/data/uploads/nlp4re-rp-template.pdf). Please notice that we do not allow submission of Report Papers from teams who submitted these types of papers to NLP4RE'18.

## Vision Papers

**4 pages (plus 1 page for references)**, outlining roadmaps for research in the workshop's topics, including industrial  and research challenges based on currently available knowledge. Specifically, we encourage contributions that highlight challenges faced by industrial practitioners when dealing with requirements expressed in NL, and faced by academics in technology transfer studies.

## Tool Papers

**4 pages (including screenshots and references)**, in which the authors provide a short description of an NLP-based tool for RE with screenshots, together with a clear **plan for a demo** at the workshop. These contributions do not require novelty with respect to previous work, and the authors can also showcase tools that have been presented in past conferences and workshops. These papers will be evaluated based on the potential interest raised by the tool, and based on the clarity of the plan for the demo.
