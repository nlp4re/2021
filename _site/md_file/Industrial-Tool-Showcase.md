Each company will showcase their tool based on an automatic door specification for a car, inspired by the way specification documents are written at Mercedes-Benz Passenger Car Development. The PDF document  can be dowloaded [here](http://fmt.isti.cnr.it/nlp4re/data/uploads/demo-spec-automatic-door.pdf). Versions in other formats are available [here](http://fmt.isti.cnr.it/nlp4re/data/uploads/Archive.zip).

**Disclaimer:** although inspired by real-world systems, it does neither reflect a current nor a future system that is part of Mercedes-Benz Passenger Cars. It intentionally contains requirements defects and other flaws that may occur during writing specificaition documents in industry.
